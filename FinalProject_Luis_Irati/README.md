## Digilent PmodCLP LCD module connections

PmodCLP LCD module is a 16Ã—2 character LCD module that uses a 8-bit parallel data interface. The PmodCLP utilizes a Samsung KS0066 LCD controller to display information to a Sunlike LCD panel. This is its pinout description table:

In our case, we have interfaced our LCD in 4-bit mode. We heve used nine ports: 4 data bits (DB4, DB5, DB6, DB7), GND, VCC, RS, R/W and E

- DB4: data bit 4, connected to digital port PD4
- DB5: data bit 5, connected to digital port PD5
- DB6: data bit 6, connected to digital port PD6
- DB7: data bit 7, connected to digital port PD7
- GND: connected to ground node
- VCC: connected to VCC node
- RS: Register Select (High for Data Transfer, Low for Instruction Transfer), connected to digital port PB0
- R/W: Read/Write signal ( High or Read mode, Low for Write mode), connected to GND.
- E: Read/Write Enable (High for Read, falling edge writes data) connected to PB1

## Joystick connections
The joystick has five ports: GND, 5V, VRx, VRy and SW
- GND is connected to ground node
- 5V is connected to Vcc node
- VRx is an analog output that gives voltage proportional to X axis
- VRy is an analog output that gives voltage proportional to Y axis
- SW is the digital output of the pushbutton

## Rotary encoder connections
The rotary encoder has five ports: CLK, DT, SW, +, GND
- GND is connected to ground node
- + is connected to Vcc node
- CLK gives digital value of A output
- DT gives digital value of B output
- SW gives digital value of pushbutton
